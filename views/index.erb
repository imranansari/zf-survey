      Zaytoon Wellness Survey
    </header>
    <div class="mainContent">
      Zaytoons Wellness is considering offering a special health outreach primarily to its restaurant customers.
      I have long been concerned with the unbelievable harm that TOXINS are causing to our bodies.
      <br>
      Many health professionals arc convinced that toxicity may lead to cancer, heart disease, and other serious
      ailments,
      <br><br>
      We must do all that is practical to reduce toxins within our bodies. My research indicates that Infrared SAUNA
      treatments are a wonderful way to reduce toxins and improve overall health. Just some of the many benefits include
      clearer skin and weight loss. 30 minutes can burn up to 600 calories!.
      <br>
      The sauna session is safe and will leave you refreshed and conveniently, can be done during a lunch hour if one is
      pressed for time. Bring some comfortable changing clothes. Shower is not required, and a wet towels will be
      provided. Showers are not needed because when you are using this type of sauna your body needs to maintain a
      steady temperature in order to receive the prolonged health benefits.So Hop into the sauna and get all the health
      benefits
      <br><br>
      My question to you is:
      Do you think this type of wellness service would be of interest to Zaytoons patrons assuming it can be affordably
      priced?
      <br><br>
      Thank you so much, Annah
